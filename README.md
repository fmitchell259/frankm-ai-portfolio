# showcase_site
A simple, static site to showcase projects and host on a  Raspberry Pi.

Using the dummy website I built during the tutorial as a template, and making custom adjustments to style as I go. 

Aiming for a few simple routes to allow the user to ability to browse my projects, visit my github page, find out a bit about me and also get in touch.
